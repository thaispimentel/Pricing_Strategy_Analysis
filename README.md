# Data-Driven Pricing Strategy: Analyzing Revenue Trends and Opportunities

## ðŸ“Œ Objective of the Study
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the sales performance of a bicycle shop over the years 2021 and 2022. The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of increasing sales prices in the forthcoming year. The study includes a thorough examination of revenue and profit trends, as well as an analysis of rider demographic data to uncover valuable insights.

## ðŸ’¼ Project Description

The initial analysis involved cleaning and organizing the raw data using SQL. This process provided a more consolidated view of the data, resulting in a table that includes the key variables for my analysis, along with two essential columns: Revenue and Profit.

**Dictionary of present variables:**
- __Dteday:__ date of the transaction in a specific format (DD/MM/YYYY). 
- __Season:__ indicates the season during which the transaction occurred (e.g., Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). It helps in understanding seasonal trends in sales and customer behavior.
- __Yr:__ year of the transaction. We use Boolean numbers: 0 to indicate 2021 and 1 to indicate 2022.
- __Weekday:__ day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) when the transaction took place. 
- __Hr:__  hour of the day.
- __Rider_type:__ This categorical variable describes the type of rider - Casual and Registered.
- __Price:__ sale price of the product or service offered. 
- __COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):__ the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the bicycle shop. 
- __Revenue:__ total income generated from sales before any costs are deducted.
- __Profit:__ This variable calculates the net income earned from sales after subtracting COGS and other expenses.

After that, I connected Power BI to the database, creating the dashboard, emphasizing the following data required for analysis: hourly revenue analysis, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue and rider demographics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights e ConclusÃµes

Data indicates that a 25% increase in price leads to a 64% increase in demand. This growth indicates a robust demand for the shop's services, suggesting that there may be room for a price increase in the upcoming year. Given that the average price in 2022 was $4.99, a conservative increase of 10-15% could potentially set the new price between $5.49 and $5.74. 

However, it is crucial to conduct further market analysis to gauge customer sensitivity to price changes and monitor sales data closely post-implementation. This approach will help ensure that any increase does not adversely affect customer retention or demand.

In summary, the strong performance metrics and increased rider engagement suggest that a price increase could be feasible and beneficial in the next year, provided that it is implemented thoughtfully and supported by ongoing market research.
